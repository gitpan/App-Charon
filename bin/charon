=head1 NAME

charon - Share files over HTTP easily and conveniently

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Start up C<charon>:

 $ charon
 serving /home/frew on 0.0.0.0:3000 with a query param auth of ?auth=br5Y2jX55

Now you can navigate to C<http://127.0.0.1:3000/?auth=br5Y2jX55> and download
files under C</home/frew>.

Here's an example of using it with all the switches:

 charon ~ --listen *:8080 --autoshutdown 1h --query-param-auth '' --no-index

=head1 DESCRIPTION

 Charon is the ferryman of Hades who carries souls of the newly deceased across
 the rivers Styx and Acheron that divided the world of the living from the world
 of the dead

C<charon> is a tool for easily sharing files.  I have found that at work I often
have trouble ensuring all the various permissions are correct and all the
various machines have the right tools and whatnot to serve files from one
machine to another.  C<charon> helps with this by making some of what used to be
Plack oneliners into a much more robust and convenient tool.

=head1 COMMANDLINE OPTIONS

=head2 single positional argument

 charon ~/code/DBIx-Class-Candy

The one and only positional argument to C<charon> is the directory or file to
serve.  The default is the current directory, but you can pass another directory
or even file if you want to serve something else.

=head2 --listen -l

 charon --listen *:5000

 charon -l 10.6.1.6:9090

If you want to choose the port and IP to listen on use this option.  Currently
only one C<--listen> is supported, but I would be glad to add support for
multiple in the future.

=head2 --autoshutdown

 charon --autoshutdown 30m

 charon --autoshutdown 1h3m20s

C<--autoshutdown> requires a single argument that expresses a duration.  The
point is so that you can timebox your file sharing and then after the duration
it will just go away, instead of you forgetting to shut it down and leaving it
running forever.

=head2 --query-param-auth

 charon --query-param-auth 'password=station'

 charon --query-param-auth ''

Query param auth is just a handy way to be able to send moderately authenticated
links to your friends.  This is on by default and generates a password with the
key of C<auth>, so links will be C<http://foo:3001/bar.tar.gz?auth=bd75z4j>.  If
you want to choose the key and value pass C<$key=$value>, so if you pass
C<password=42> you could use the link C<http://foo:3001/bar.tar.gz?password=42>.

Note that while this is on by default I may decide to change that in the future.

=head2 --index --no-index

 charon --no-index

This option is on by default, and allows the client to get an html based
directory listing.  You might turn this off if you want to have a bit more
security-through-obscurity to allow only sharing files you give people links to.

=head2 --help -h

 charon -h

Use C<--help> to get a brief listing of the options.
